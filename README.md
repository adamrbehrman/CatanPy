# Catan Solver using previous java code (hopefully it works this time)

There are 19 hexagonal Tiles in standard 3-4 player Catan, arranged in a hexagonal shape.

A Tile represents a resource: Ore, Wheat, Sheep, Wood, Brick

Each Tile is assigned a number between 2 and 12 representing the dice roll that will yield its resource if the player has a Building on it.

A Building (settlement or city) is considered "on" a resource if it is at the intersection of the Tile.
